# The link discovery (link_info, rails, rail_info, rail_ping, cx7_peer) is adapted from the 2x DGX Sparks recipe's
# scripts/nodes.sh (github.com/MiaAI-Lab/GLM-5.3-Flash-EXL3-2x-DGX-Sparks-TensorFold, branch zig-engine), trimmed to
# two ranks. The lessons in it are that recipe's: the GID index must be the RoCE v2 entry that holds the node's own
# IPv4 address, and a DGX Spark's single QSFP port reaches the GB10 over two PCIe links, so one cable shows up as two
# netdevs and two RDMA devices and both have to be given to NCCL (and to the engine's RoCE path) for the port's full
